LFNutils, v1.0.0

When you start using Linux, everything seems difficult.
linuxfornoobs.org helps with getting a system up and running with basic commands, but what if I still don't get it?

Shouldn't I just be able to run "help" with a command and it tells me everything?
LFNutils (Linux For Noobs utils) aims to fill in a useless help command with a complete explanation about what the command does, how to use it, and more.
